# Assignment 2: Vector & Matrix Operations in C#

## Library Used
- **OpenTK** (for creating the project window and handling vectors/matrices).

## Features Implemented

### Vector Operations
- **Addition** of two vectors
- **Subtraction** of two vectors
- **Dot product** of two vectors
- **Cross product** of two vectors

### Matrix Operations
- **Identity matrix**
- **Scaling matrix**
- **Rotation matrix** (around the X-axis)
- **Matrix multiplication**

## How to Run
1. Open the project in Visual Studio (requires **.NET 6.0** or **.NET 8.0**).  
2. Build the project.  
3. Run the program â€” a small window with a green rectangle should appear.  
4. Check the console for example vector/matrix operation outputs.

## Example Output

Vector Addition: (5, 7, 9).
Vector Subtraction: (-3, -3, -3).
Dot Product: 32.
Cross Product: (-3, 6, -3).
Original Vector: (1, 0, 0).
Scaled + Rotated Vector: (1.4142135, 1.4142135, 0).
