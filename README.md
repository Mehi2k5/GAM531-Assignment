# Assignment 3: Rendering a 3D Cube

## Library Used
This project uses **OpenTK 4.9.4** with **.NET 8.0**.  
OpenTK provides the bindings to OpenGL needed to render 2D/3D graphics in C#.

## How the Cube Was Rendered
- Defined a cube using **8 unique 3D vertices** and indices to draw faces.
- Applied a **perspective projection matrix** to simulate 3D depth.
- Used a **view matrix** to position the camera looking at the cube.
- Implemented a simple **rotation transformation on the Y-axis** so the cube spins in place.
- Enabled **depth testing** to ensure correct face visibility when rendering.

The program creates an OpenGL context using OpenTKâ€™s `GameWindow`, sets up the cube geometry, and renders it inside the main loop with continuous rotation.
